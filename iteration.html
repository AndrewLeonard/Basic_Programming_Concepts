<h1 class="style1">Iteration (looping) </h1>
<p class="style1">Applying a function repeatedly.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Iteration is a bit like  a car going round a roundabout.</strong></p>
<p class="style1">If the driver of the car doesn't take an exit from the roundabout, the car will just keep going round and round the roundabout.</p>
<p class="style1">However if the driver of the car is told that when you have gone round the roundabout 10 times you must exit the roundabout, then the &quot;loop&quot; is broken.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="style1">Two types of iteration.</h2>
<p class="style1">1 - A never ending loop, goes on forever.</p>
<p class="style1">2 - A loop that goes round and round until something happens within the loop to make it exit the loop.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">We normally only use the 2nd type of loop, as the first loop slows the program and computer down, it is a bit like a hamster in a running wheel, it goes round and round and round and not going anywhere. <br />
</p>
<h3 class="style1">Iteration is used for a variety of reasons in coding.</h3>
<p class="style1"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p class="style1">A Timer on a game</p>
<pre class="style1">while (Timer &lt;= 5)  {

other code goes here</pre>
<p class="style1">}</p>
<pre class="style1">document.write(&quot;You have run out of time.&quot;);</pre>
